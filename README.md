# AboutMe
I'm a PhD student, and as such I'm trained to answer questions with data.

Here and on Twitter or at the Oilers Rig, I do so with respect to the Edmonton Oilers. I do it there because my professional blog is not somewhere people would actually care.

If you're here, it's likely because I linked you here at the end of a blog post or something. Reach me @OilersRational if you need help running or understanding any of my code.

I'm trying to make any of my public Oilers work reproducible, and also allow for any interesteed party to edit and run similar analysis if the urge strikes them.

My e key is jammed, so stick taps if you notice a double e typo.
